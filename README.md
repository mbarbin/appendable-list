# appendable-list

[![CI Status](https://github.com/mbarbin/appendable-list/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mbarbin/appendable-list/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This library offers a repackaging of `Core_extended`'s `Appendable_list`, as a
standalone opam package.

Original code at https://github.com/janestreet/core_extended/tree/master/appendable_list

The code was slightly modified in order to remove dependencies into `Core` and
solely depend on `Base` instead, making it available in more contexts, without
requiring to add a dependency into `Core` and `Core_extended`.

## Code Documentation

The code documentation of the latest release is built with `odoc` and published
to `GitHub` pages [here](https://mbarbin.github.io/appendable-list).
